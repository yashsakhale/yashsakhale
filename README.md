### I'm a grad student at the Carnegie Mellon University pursuing M.S in Artificial Intelligence - Mechanical Engineering. 
ðŸ”­ My interests lie in AI / ML applied in Autonomous vehicles and Perception Engineering and that explains all the topics of my projects in their respective repositories.

âš¡Currently, I am a part of Carnegie Mellon University's Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB), and my industry sponsored project is modeling of LiDAR sensors - OS1 ouster 128, utilizing camera lidar fusion and predictive models to de-filter or potentially eliminate dust particles from the point cloud data of an autonomous vehicle deployed on construction and mining sites. I will not be uploading anything related to my research, if you want to discuss you can reach out to me personally 




### *If you're reading this, you are here way too early. I have just started building my github again and it is going to take a while so hang tight and visit again soon till im done uploading and sorting everything! Feel free to contact me if you want to chat - Email ID : ysakhale@andrew.cmu.edu || Linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-sakhale-5924121b8/ *
